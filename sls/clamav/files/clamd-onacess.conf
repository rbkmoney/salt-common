#DisableCache no

##
## Executable files
##

# PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file format used
# in all 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems. This option allows
# ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of executable files and it's also
# required for decompression of popular executable packers such as UPX, FSG,
# and Petite. If you turn off this option, the original files will still be
# scanned, but without additional processing.
ScanPE no

# Certain PE files contain an authenticode signature. By default, we check
# the signature chain in the PE file against a database of trusted and
# revoked certificates if the file being scanned is marked as a virus.
# If any certificate in the chain validates against any trusted root, but
# does not match any revoked certificate, the file is marked as whitelisted.
# If the file does match a revoked certificate, the file is marked as virus.
# The following setting completely turns off authenticode verification.
DisableCertCheck no

# Executable and Linking Format is a standard format for UN*X executables.
# This option allows you to control the scanning of ELF files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without additional processing.
ScanELF yes

# With this option clamav will try to detect broken executables (both PE and
# ELF) and mark them as Broken.Executable.
DetectBrokenExecutables no

##
## Mail files
##

# Enable internal e-mail scanner.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without parsing individual messages/attachments.
ScanMail no

# Allow heuristic match to take precedence.
# When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects
# a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU
# scan-time.
# When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at
# the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected
# virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported
#
# Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses
# differently from "real" malware.
# If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first,
# the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
#
#HeuristicScanPrecedence no

##
## Limits
##

# The options below protect your system against Denial of Service attacks
# using archive bombs.

# This option sets the maximum amount of data to be scanned for each input file.
# Archives and other containers are recursively extracted and scanned up to this
# value.
# Value of 0 disables the limit
# Note: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage
# to the system.
MaxScanSize 100M

# Files larger than this limit won't be scanned. Affects the input file itself
# as well as files contained inside it (when the input file is an archive, a
# document or some other kind of container).
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Note: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage
# to the system.
MaxFileSize 50M

# Nested archives are scanned recursively, e.g. if a Zip archive contains a RAR
# file, all files within it will also be scanned. This options specifies how
# deeply the process should be continued.
# Note: setting this limit too high may result in severe damage to the system.
MaxRecursion 10

# Number of files to be scanned within an archive, a document, or any other
# container file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.

# than this value will skip the step to potentially reanalyze as PE.
# Note: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage
# to the system.
MaxZipTypeRcg 1M

# This option sets the maximum number of partitions of a raw disk image to be scanned.
# Raw disk images with more partitions than this value will have up to the value number
# partitions scanned. Negative values are not allowed.
# Note: setting this limit too high may result in severe damage or impact performance.
MaxPartitions 50

# This option sets the maximum recursive calls for HWP3 parsing during scanning.
# HWP3 files using more than this limit will be terminated and alert the user.

# WARNING: setting this limit too high may severely impact performance.
PCRERecMatchLimit 10000

# This option sets the maximum filesize for which PCRE subsigs will be executed.
# Files exceeding this limit will not have PCRE subsigs executed unless a subsig is encompassed to a smaller buffer.
# Negative values are not allowed.
# Setting this value to zero disables the limit.
# WARNING: setting this limit too high or disabling it may severely impact performance.

# It is highly recommended you keep this option on, otherwise you'll miss detections for many new viruses.
Bytecode yes

# Set bytecode security level.
# Possible values:
#       None - no security at all, meant for debugging. DO NOT USE THIS ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
#         This value is only available if clamav was built with --enable-debug!
#       TrustSigned - trust bytecode loaded from signed .c[lv]d files,
#                insert runtime safety checks for bytecode loaded from other sources
#       Paranoid - don't trust any bytecode, insert runtime checks for all
# Recommended: TrustSigned, because bytecode in .cvd files already has these checks
# Note that by default only signed bytecode is loaded, currently you can only
# load unsigned bytecode in --enable-debug mode.
